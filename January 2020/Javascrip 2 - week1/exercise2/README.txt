Exercise 2: About me

Start with this HTML and save it as "about_me.html":

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>About Me</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>Nickname: <span id="nickname"></span></li>
      <li>Favorite food: <span id="fav-food"></span></li>
      <li>Hometown: <span id="hometown"></span></li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>

Add a script tag to the bottom of the HTML body.
(In the JavaScript) Change the body tag's style so it has a font-family of "Arial, sans-serif".
(In the JavaScript) Replace each of the spans (nickname, fav-food, hometown) with your own information.
Iterate through each li and change the class to "list-item".
(In the HTML head) Add a style tag that sets a rule for .list-item to make the color red.
Create a new img element and set its src attribute to a picture of you. Append that element to the page.
