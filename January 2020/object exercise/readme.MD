In Javascript objects are collections of "key:value" pairs. 

How we create an object?
-------------------------

k. All you have to do is throw your key value pairs separated by ‘:’ inside a set of curly braces({ }) and your object is ready to be served (or consumed), like below:

const person = {
    firstName: 'Paris',
    lastName: 'Charalampidis'
}
