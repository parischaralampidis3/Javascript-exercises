singleton pattern 

it's a manifestation of the module pattern.
A singleton pattern is an immediate anonymous function and it can only return only one instance of an object at a time, meaning that repeated calls to the constructor will return the same instance.
Like the module pattern it mantains a private reference which nothing from the outside can access
Often times singletons are frowned upon because they give you a global point of access rather than embracing encapsulation
Also the can be hard to debug
